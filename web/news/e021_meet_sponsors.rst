It has now been two months since we began our
`BountySource fundraiser <https://salt.bountysource.com/teams/nim>`_. We
promised to create a "Current sponsors" page and are happy to announce that
it is now live `here <http://nim-lang.org/sponsors.html>`_.

We are happy to say that last month we raised more than in the previous month!
A staggering $862 was raised during that month and we thank each and every one
of you once again for your generous contributions.

We are gearing up for a brand new release of Nim that includes many bug fixes
and some new features. In the meantime, as always, feel free to get in
touch with us via `Twitter <https://twitter.com/nim_lang>`_, the
`#nim channel on Freenode <http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=nim>`_
or via email at contact@nim-lang.org.

Thanks for reading!
