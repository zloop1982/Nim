I am very happy to say that just last week I have put the finishing touches
on Nim in Action. The final manuscript has been submitted to Manning (the book's
publisher), and the printed version is expected to start shipping in March
2017 (give or take 1 month).

The eBook is still available and now contains all of the book's chapters,
including new ones dealing with the foreign function interface and
metaprogramming.
That said, it may still take some time before the eBook is updated with the
latest corrections.

I am incredibly thankful to everyone that purchased the book already. Many of
you have also given me a lot of `brilliant <http://forum.nim-lang.org/t/1978>`_
`feedback <https://forums.manning.com/forums/nim-in-action>`_,
thank you very much for
taking the time to do so. I have done my best to act on this
feedback and I hope you will agree that the book has risen in quality as a
result.

Writing this book has been both exhausting and incredible at the same time.
I look forward
to having a physical copy of it in my hands, and I'm sure many of you do as
well. I can safely say that without your support this book would not have
happened, even if you did not purchase a copy your interest in Nim has made it
possible and I thank you for that.

As always, you can make a purchase on
`Manning's website <https://manning.com/books/nim-in-action?a_aid=niminaction&a_bid=78a27e81>`_.
Both eBook's and printed books are available, and purchasing a printed book will
get you an eBook for free.
